## Why Butcher Your Own Deer?

Butchering your own deer offers numerous benefits:

- **Cost-Effective:** Save money by processing your own meat.
- **Quality Control:** Ensure the meat is handled and processed to your standards.
- **Satisfaction:** There's a sense of accomplishment in doing it yourself.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, gather the following tools and equipment:

## Step-by-Step Guide to Deer Butchering

### 1. **Prepare Your Workspace**

Ensure your workspace is clean and well-lit. Cover your cutting board with plastic wrap to make cleanup easier.

### 2. **Field Dressing**

If you haven't already, field dress the deer as soon as possible after the hunt. Remove the internal organs to cool the carcass quickly.

### 3. **Skinning the Deer**

- **Position the Deer:** Lay the deer on its back.
- **Make the First Cut:** Start at the chest and make a cut down the belly to the anus.
- **Remove the Hide:** Peel the hide away from the meat, using your knife to cut around joints and tough areas.

### 4. **Removing the Head and Feet**

- **Head:** Cut through the neck at the base of the skull.
- **Feet:** Cut through the joints at the knees and ankles.

### 5. **Splitting the Carcass**

- **Cut Down the Spine:** Using a saw, cut down the spine from the tail to the neck.
- **Separate the Halves:** Split the carcass into two halves.

### 6. **Removing the Backstraps**

- **Locate the Backstraps:** These are the long, tender muscles along the spine.
- **Cut Along the Spine:** Carefully cut along the spine to remove the backstraps.

### 7. **Removing the Ribs and Shoulders**

- **Ribs:** Cut along the ribcage to remove the ribs.
- **Shoulders:** Cut through the shoulder joints to remove the shoulder meat.

### 8. **Removing the Hindquarters**

- **Cut Through the Hip Joints:** Remove the hindquarters by cutting through the hip joints.

### 9. **Trimming and Packaging**

- **Package the Meat:** Divide the meat into manageable portions and package it for storage or cooking.

## Tips for Handling and Storing Meat
